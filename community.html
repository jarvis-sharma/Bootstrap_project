        <p class="lead">Your choice of programming communities (know as discussion boards, forums, bulletin boards,
            etc.) will often
            determine the pace of your progression in your particular language that you’re learning. I don’t think there
            is an answer as to why, but real-time communities provide a one of a kind learning experience.

            The problem lies into the fact that there is a vast choice of programming communities out there, and one out
            of five webmasters feel confident enough to start their own communities; which never leads to anything good.
            It creates the delusion that this new community is going to be better than the last one, supposedly because
            it is a new community, and it promises to help every newbie on the planet.

            I’d rather have real programmers throw stones at me than to wait in line for an answer from the poor
            webmaster who’s already so caught up in his own projects, that he instantly regrets the idea of starting his
            own community in the first place. I’ve been there, I should know.
